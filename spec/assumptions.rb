  # Objects should belong to 0 or 1 acquisitions. This is required for

  # The object's acquisitions association returns an array, but only because a 
  # many-to-many relationship is required by the schema (two tables joined by 
  # an intermediate mapping table). The assumption is that if the database were 
  # designed differently each object could have one acquisition id. Following 
  # this assumption the one object that CollectionObject#acquisitions returns is
  # the first, and presumed only, member of the array. If any object were found 
  # to belong to two acquisitions we would have to get rid of this method.
